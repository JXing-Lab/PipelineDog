# PipelineDog Web App Guide: Start From Scratch

======

##1. With a compatible web browser, go to www.pipeline.dog
Visit this web address (www.pipeline.dog) with a compatible web browser, and you have reached the PipelineDog Web App. The current list of tested compatible web browers are: Safari (v 10.0.1 or above), Opera (v 40.0 or above), and Chrome (v 54.0 or above).  

You should arrive a web page similar to this one:  
<p align="center">
  <kbd>
    <img src="https://github.com/ysunlab/PipelineDog/blob/master/img.d/startPage.jpg?raw=true" alt="Start Page" />
  </kbd>
</p>
And this is the starting page for the PipelineDog Web App.  

##2. Optional (but recommended): read the PipelineDog documentations
The documentations specifically for PipelineDog are here: https://github.com/ysunlab/PipelineDog  

##3. Start a new project by clicking the `START` button  
Because we are starting from scratch, you don't need to select or upload any project files (as suggested in the box with dotted line).  

##4. Know a little bit about the PipelineDog Web App interface  
After you have clicked the `START` button, you should land on the following page:  
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ysunlab/PipelineDog/blob/master/img.d/JustStarted.jpg?raw=true" alt="Just Started Page" />
</p>

The interface is divided into two large parts, a panel part on the left side, and a larger editor part on the right.  

On the left, from top to bottom, there is a `Global Variables` section (we will not use in this simple example), the `List Files` tab (a `Default List` file has already been created for you, and pre-selected by default, i.e., with a gray background), and the `Steps` tab (a `Default Step` has been created for you).  

On the right, the `EDITOR` window now display the content of the pre-selected `Default List`.
